### About Me
I am third year undergraduate student majoring in **Mathematics - Computer Science** and minoring in **Data Science** at UC San Diego. Here's a little fun fact about me: I'm a leap day baby (born on February 29th), so I'm technically only 5 years old! I also like to dabble in a bit of frontend development (ig some backend if i feel like it).

These are my top 3 programming languages, in descending order:

1. [Python](README.md)
2. Java
3. C++

### Interests
Here are some of things I enjoy:
- [cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat)
- traveling (here's a picture I took in [korea](photos/travel.jpeg))
- cats
- cats
- cats
- playing video games
- kpop
- wait, did i say cats already?

Here's a quote I take inspiration from everyday:
> "To err is human, to purr is feline" - Robert Byrne
